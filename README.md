# Arbovirus_project_ErasmusMC
This is a repository for our project 'A MinION-based pipeline for tracking arboviruses'.\
This repository includes a workflow of our pipeline, an environment file ,a snakefile with our pipeline that includes NanoPlot in the pipeline (this pipeline does not run in one go), a snakefile that includes the pipeline without quality checks and a snakefile that only has the NanoPlot steps.\
This project is executed by Roy McCabe and Noah Walraven. Students from Avans Hogeschool.
